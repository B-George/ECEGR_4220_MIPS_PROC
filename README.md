# ECEGR_4220_MIPS_PROC
Continuation of previous mips processor development
This will be a fully funciontal 32-bit MIPS processor implemented on an Altera Cyclone IV FPGA dev board
As of 12.1.2015, the processor has the capability to do the following operations: 
add
addi
sub
and
or
ori
sll
srl
Basic SRAM functionality has been tested, with the ability to read instructions from memory.
The next step is to implement bi-directional memory for the LW and SW operations.
